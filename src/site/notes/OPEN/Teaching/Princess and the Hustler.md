## About the play

> Protest and grief also feature in _Princess & The Hustler_ by Chinonyerem Odimba, produced at Bristol Old Vic Theatre by Eclipse Theatre, Bristol Old Vic and Hull Truck Theatre, before going on a UK tour. This domestic drama, set in 1963 in the home of a Black family, combines the politics of colourism with the Bristol bus boycott – a seminal Black British Civil Rights action that led to the Race Relations Act of 1965. As part of Eclipse Theatre’s Revolution Mix – a theatrical intervention to undo the erasure of Black British Stories across five centuries – Odimba, in 2019, brings a recent but under-celebrated story into our consciousness, forcing us to confront the history of race politics in Bristol. Just a year later, the statue of Edward Colston was toppled and pushed into Bristol Harbour during that summer’s Black Lives Matter protests – an action that demanded the city acknowledge but not celebrate the city’s role in the slave trade.

> Whilst Kene is telling the story of the colonisation of parts of London that sees his neighbour Dreadlock Rasta being replaced by Redhead Eddie, Odimba explores the legacy of colonisation in Britain: Jamaican-born-and-bred Wendall goes into the service to fight for Britain and is discharged after an incident and with a lung condition. He is promised a job and a future in England only to be disrespected and made invisible – kept from being able to make a living and support his family in a land that wants his life but not him or his labour.
